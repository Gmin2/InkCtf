# Vault - Completed! 🎉

You've cracked the vault! The "private" password wasn't so private after all.

---

## What You Learned

The `private` keyword in smart contracts only provides **code-level visibility**, not **data-level privacy**.

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct Vault {
    locked: bool,
    password: String,  // "Private" but stored in public storage!
}

// No getter function... but data is still readable!
```

## How Storage Works

| Layer | Visibility |
|-------|------------|
| Source Code | Can hide getters |
| Compiled Contract | Bytecode is public |
| Blockchain Storage | **100% Public** |

Every piece of data on the blockchain is publicly readable via:
- Block explorers
- RPC calls (`state_getStorage`)
- Direct node queries

---

## Key Takeaways

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Private variables are hidden" | All storage is public |
| "No getter = no access" | Anyone can read storage directly |
| "Secrets can be stored on-chain" | Never store secrets on-chain! |

---

## What NOT to Store On-Chain

- 🚫 Passwords
- 🚫 Private keys
- 🚫 API secrets
- 🚫 Personal/sensitive information

---

## Proper Secret Handling

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Hash Storage** | Store `keccak256(password)`, verify with hash comparison |
| **Off-chain Secrets** | Keep secrets off-chain, verify proofs on-chain |
| **Commit-Reveal** | Commit hash first, reveal later |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** | Prove knowledge without revealing |
